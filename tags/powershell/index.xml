Among many other functionalities, it offers you the possibility to run background jobs and schedule your scripts to run at certain times. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we will be exploring today.
Before we start - Let&amp;rsquo;s understand the product naming ðŸ”—This might sound irrelevant for now, but you will understand in a minute why I&amp;rsquo;m mentioning this.
The first time I heard about an Ironman Software product it was the Universal Dashboard (UD).</description></item><item><title>dbatools is not just for DBAs - Import-DbaCsv</title><link>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/dbatools-is-not-just-for-dbas---import-dbacsv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/dbatools-is-not-just-for-dbas---import-dbacsv/</guid><description>The first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about dbatools was on its early stages and, although it seemed really interesting, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about PowerShell, nor I had to work with SQL professionally. Moreover, to me it looked like it was &amp;ldquo;focused&amp;rdquo; on helping DBAs (maybe hence its name?). Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve never contributed to the project, I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept an eye on it.
Why do I need it now? Some context ðŸ”—I usually have to analyse logs in order to perform some C#/SQL troubleshooting/debugging/performance tuning.</description></item><item><title>PSConfEU - First time at this event?

It covers a lot of different topics and brings professionals from all over the world.
&amp;ldquo;In 2020, weâ€™ll have 350 delegate seats again and 40 international speakers&amp;rdquo;
It has talks about DSC, PowerShell internals, Azure, DevOps, IoT and many other areas.
This conference is simply amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to announce that I will be speaking! Last year was my first time attending and speaking at a conference outside my country, and PSConfEU was the one.</description></item><item><title>Remote Sessions and notifications</title><link>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/remote-sessions-and-notifications/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/remote-sessions-and-notifications/</guid><description>On my last post, in the very end, I showed you an example of something quite simple that you could do with PowerShell on the RaspberryPi: Show a notification when a LED is left ON.
In this post I will show you how I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to display the notification. This will consist of three sections:
How to display a notification Enabling remote sessions through SSH The final script to display a notification from one device to another Showing a notification ðŸ”—Because @WindosNZ #BurntToast module is awesome, I figured that there was something cool that I could do with it!</description></item><item><title>Getting started with PowerShell (Core) on Raspbian (RaspberryPi)</title><link>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/getting-started-with-powershell-core-on-raspbian-raspberrypi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.danielssilva.dev/post/getting-started-with-powershell-core-on-raspbian-raspberrypi/</guid><description>Around a year ago, I started to investigate about new usages for my Raspberry Pi 3b . I love the Raspberry, a tiny, credit-card-sized SBC capable of running different operating systems, but most of the projects I found that seemed interesting were highly complex (or at least seemed) and used python, a language that I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with. Around the same time, I also started to hear a lot about PowerShell (or maybe it caught my attention because I&amp;rsquo;ve started to use it at my work for simple stuff), as a scripting language mainly used (as far as I knew) to automate tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
