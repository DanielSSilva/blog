It covers a lot of different topics and brings professionals from all over the world.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 2020, we‚Äôll have 350 delegate seats again and 40 international speakers&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>It has talks about DSC, PowerShell internals, Azure, DevOps, IoT and many other areas.</p><p>This conference is simply amazing and I&rsquo;m really happy to announce that I will be speaking!
Last year was my first time attending and speaking at a conference outside my country, and PSConfEU was the one.
I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better experience.
Let me share my experience with you, specially if you are a newcomer.</p><h1 id=why-psconfeu>Why PSConfEU <a href=#why-psconfeu class=anchor>üîó</a></h1><p>It all started as a joke/challenge/objective two years ago, when there were people posting about #sadJoey.
At some point, <a href=https://twitter.com/DanielSilv9/status/991009571757088769 target=_blank rel=noopener>I replied</a> to Tyler (<a href=https://tylerleonhardt.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>b</a>|<a href=https://twitter.com/TylerLeonhardt target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>) on Twitter saying that we would be going on the next year.
In December the CFP opened and I decided to submit two sessions about PowerShell IoT and, to my surprise, I&rsquo;ve got accepted.</p><p>The other reason is that I&rsquo;ve been to Germany once and really loved it, so it was a perfect excuse to go back.</p><h1 id=the-environment>The environment <a href=#the-environment class=anchor>üîó</a></h1><p>Other than this conference, I&rsquo;ve only been in conferences in my hometown (Lisbon), such as <a href=http://sqlport.com/sql-server/ target=_blank rel=noopener>SQLPort</a>, <a href=https://sqlsaturday.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>SQLSaturday</a> and <a href=https://tugait.pt/ target=_blank rel=noopener>TugaIT</a>.
Although the environment on those conferences is really good, there&rsquo;s something special about PSConfEU.
It might be because it was the first (and only so far) conference that I&rsquo;ve attended outside my country.
It&rsquo;s also much bigger, not only in time (5 days) but in attendees as well. Also, it&rsquo;s related to an area that I feel more comfortable with.</p><p>Before attending to the conference, I think I can count by my hands how many people I knew that were going to be there too (and if we consider those that I&rsquo;ve met in person, 1 hand is enough), and I&rsquo;m only talking about the speakers.
As you might imagine (and if you are a speaker you might have been through it as well), it&rsquo;s fascinating and terrifying at the same time.
I&rsquo;ve always heard that people at conferences are really amazing and friendly, but never expected such engagement.
Now I need more than both of my hands to count the people I&rsquo;ve keep contact with.</p><p>Let me be honest&mldr; I kind of had the idea that it would be &ldquo;clustered&rdquo;, by having different groups of people that already knew each other, and the &ldquo;celebrities&rdquo; were just going to be a group and it would be really hard to feel integrated.
Sure there were groups of people, but as far as I&rsquo;ve noticed, not those groups that just talk to each other and don&rsquo;t speak to anyone else.</p><p><em><strong>Narrator</strong></em>: he was totally wrong.</p><p>Now that I&rsquo;m writing this, and after being there, I feel bad that I even thought that way.</p><p>Let me put it this way: I, someone who knows &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; about PowerShell when compared to probably most of the other folks, talked to Jeffrey Snover(<a href=http://jsnover.com/index.html#Oct11_jps_1 target=_blank rel=noopener>b</a>|<a href=https://twitter.com/jsnover target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>), Bruce Payette(<a href=https://twitter.com/BrucePayette target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>), Lee Holmes(<a href=https://www.leeholmes.com/blog/ target=_blank rel=noopener>b</a>|<a href=https://twitter.com/Lee_Holmes target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>), Steve Lee(<a href=https://twitter.com/Steve_MSFT target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>), among many other &ldquo;celebrities&rdquo; like we already knew each other.
And most of the time we didn&rsquo;t even talked about PowerShell, but also about other companies, tech, career progress, music, etc.</p><p>The point that I&rsquo;m trying to make is that if you have a similar thought like I did, just don&rsquo;t.
It&rsquo;s such a friendly and welcoming community that you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of not feeling integrated, or that the others are way better than you (yes I&rsquo;m talking to you people with the Imposters&rsquo; Syndrome).
Everyone that I spoke to talked to me like we already knew each other and in a really kind way, even though I&rsquo;m sure most of them never heard of me before.
But there was something that surprised me: I&rsquo;ve had people coming to me like &ldquo;oh you are the raspberry and IoT guy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited about your sessions!&rdquo; and (maybe the best) &ldquo;For me, your sessions were some of the best ones this year&rdquo;.</p><p>With that said, one of the things that enjoy the most are not the sessions.
It is what happens between them and, specially, at the end of the day.
Everything I&rsquo;ve just shared with you happened between sessions, after a day of sessions, at dinner or at the hotel&rsquo;s bar.
You get to talk with <em><strong>so many</strong></em> people with different cultures, different habits, that have a career that&rsquo;s totally different than yours, and that&rsquo;s really amazing to hear and share.</p><h1 id=the-sessions>The sessions <a href=#the-sessions class=anchor>üîó</a></h1><p>This year there will be 3 tracks and from 5 to 7 &ldquo;time slots&rdquo;. This means that there will be from 15 to 21 sessions per day!
You can already <a href=https://psconf.eu/schedule target=_blank rel=noopener>check the schedule</a>. Although it&rsquo;s subject to changes, you can see the sessions that will be presented.</p><h2 id=what-ill-be-speaking-about>What I&rsquo;ll be speaking about <a href=#what-ill-be-speaking-about class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>This year I&rsquo;ll do two sessions again, one still related to PowerShell IoT, and another about C# for PowerShellers.</p><h3 id=powershell-iot-v2---whats-new-what-changed-and-what-ive-learned>PowerShell IoT v2 - What&rsquo;s new, what changed and what I&rsquo;ve learned <a href=#powershell-iot-v2---whats-new-what-changed-and-what-ive-learned class=anchor>üîó</a></h3><p>As the abstract of the session says:</p><blockquote><p>PowerShell.IoT is a free, Open Source module that allows you to interact with IoT hardware.
Since I&rsquo;ve become a maintainer of this repo, I&rsquo;ve been working to migrate the code to use System.Devices from the dotnet team.
In this session, I will share with you what has changed, what&rsquo;s new, and what I&rsquo;ve learned since I&rsquo;ve started to contribute to Open Source software, and also why you should too!</p></blockquote><p>You can expect a session with demos, new concepts, which decisions where made, why and how they were made, some C# content, what I&rsquo;ve learned so far from contributing to an Open Source project.</p><h3 id=c-for-powershellers---why-is-it-any-good-for-you>C# For PowerShellers - Why is it any good for you <a href=#c-for-powershellers---why-is-it-any-good-for-you class=anchor>üîó</a></h3><p>Quoting the session&rsquo;s abstract:</p><blockquote><p>Last year, a chart showed that the vast majority of PSConfEU attendees either don&rsquo;t know C# or don&rsquo;t use it.
Coming from a C# background this shocked me since got familiar with PowerShell because I know C#.
This session introduces C#, how to write a cmdlet, different ways to load your code into PowerShell, why is that some cmdlets are written in PowerShell and many other concepts!</p></blockquote><p>This session became a reality after last year, also at PSConfEU, Tobias(<a href=http://www.powertheshell.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>b</a>|<a href=https://twitter.com/TobiasPSP target=_blank rel=noopener>t</a>) showed a chart stating that most of the attendees either didn&rsquo;t know C# or didn&rsquo;t like it/wanted to use it.
The purpose of this session is to try to demystify that C# is a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s really hard to use with PowerShell.
Although it&rsquo;s different from PowerShell, it has many similarities, and most importantly, they use the same Framework.
For that reason, I think that I will be able to show that you already know a lot of C#, you just don&rsquo;t know yet!</p><p>Thanks for reading and I hope that you consider attending to this session, and if you do, please come say hi!</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://blog.danielssilva.dev/tags/powershell>PowerShell</a></div><div id=comments><script>var id=4,commentsDiv;if(id){let
